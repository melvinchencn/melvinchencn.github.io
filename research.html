      <h3>Nonlinear Factor Dynamics Forecasting:
A Two-Stage Autoencoder–LSTM Framework</h3>
      <p>
      We study forecasting in high-dimensional time series with nonlinear factor dynam-
ics. When the evolution of latent factors is nonlinear, traditional direct forecasting
methods suffer from structural misspecification, leading to systematic errors. Building
on recent advances in deep learning, we propose AE–LSTM, a two-stage framework
that first extracts latent factors with an autoencoder (AE) and then models their
dynamics using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The autoencoder consis-
tently recovers nonlinear structures, while the LSTM flexibly approximates dynamic
transitions, allowing the system to capture both cross-sectional and temporal nonlin-
earities. Simulation studies and an application to FRED-MD real-time vintages show
that AE–LSTM achieves systematic gains in predictive accuracy over standard lin-
ear and regularized benchmarks, underscoring the value of separating representation
learning from dynamic forecasting.

      <h3>Data-Revision Wedges in Real-Time Uncertainty Indices</h3>
      <p>
        We study real-time measurement of macroeconomic uncertainty when
the underlying data are revised. In a vintage-data factor forecasting en-
vironment, a conventional real-time y-based uncertainty index admits a
data-revision wedge, so y-based uncertainty computed from vintages can
be mechanically inflated relative to its final-data benchmark. Motivated
by this wedge, we propose a real-time factor-based index that targets the
factor-innovation component directly and show that its benchmark gap
is free of revision-driven terms. Equivalently, the real-time versus final-
data gap of the proposed index reflects only information-set differences
in factor-innovation uncertainty, whereas the corresponding gap of the
y-based index includes the data-revision wedge. The results deliver sim-
ple diagnostics that quantify benchmark recovery and revision-induced
inflation in real-time uncertainty indices.

      <h3>Structural Estimation of Inflation Channel Heterogeneity: Imported Inputs vs Final Goods</h3>
      <p>
This paper develops a New Keynesian DSGE model that distinguishes between imported intermediate
inputs and imported final consumption goods to analyze the inflationary consequences of global supply
chain disruptions. Motivated by empirical evidence from the COVID-19 period and structural shifts
in trade patterns, the model incorporates endogenous wage bargaining with labor market frictions and
nominal rigidities. Disruptions in imported intermediate inputs raise domestic marginal costs, propagate
through hiring dynamics, and generate persistent inflation via wage-price feedback. In contrast, shocks
to imported final goods alter the consumption basket composition with more transitory effects. The
model features a modified Phillips curve in which foreign input cost shocks and labor market tightness
jointly determine inflation dynamics.      </p>
