      <h3>Nonlinear Factor Dynamics Forecasting:
A Two-Stage Autoencoder–LSTM Framework</h3>
      <p>
      We study forecasting in high-dimensional time series with nonlinear factor dynam-
ics. When the evolution of latent factors is nonlinear, traditional direct forecasting
methods suffer from structural misspecification, leading to systematic errors. Building
on recent advances in deep learning, we propose AE–LSTM, a two-stage framework
that first extracts latent factors with an autoencoder (AE) and then models their
dynamics using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The autoencoder consis-
tently recovers nonlinear structures, while the LSTM flexibly approximates dynamic
transitions, allowing the system to capture both cross-sectional and temporal nonlin-
earities. Simulation studies and an application to FRED-MD real-time vintages show
that AE–LSTM achieves systematic gains in predictive accuracy over standard lin-
ear and regularized benchmarks, underscoring the value of separating representation
learning from dynamic forecasting.

      <h3>Data-Revision Wedges in Real-Time Uncertainty Indices</h3>
      <p>
        We study real-time measurement of macroeconomic uncertainty when
the underlying data are revised. In a vintage-data factor forecasting en-
vironment, a conventional real-time y-based uncertainty index admits a
data-revision wedge, so y-based uncertainty computed from vintages can
be mechanically inflated relative to its final-data benchmark. Motivated
by this wedge, we propose a real-time factor-based index that targets the
factor-innovation component directly and show that its benchmark gap
is free of revision-driven terms. Equivalently, the real-time versus final-
data gap of the proposed index reflects only information-set differences
in factor-innovation uncertainty, whereas the corresponding gap of the
y-based index includes the data-revision wedge. The results deliver sim-
ple diagnostics that quantify benchmark recovery and revision-induced
inflation in real-time uncertainty indices.

      <h3>Structural Estimation of Inflation Channel Heterogeneity: Imported Inputs vs Final Goods</h3>
      <p>
        This project studies how imported inflation transmits into domestic inflation through distinct channels associated with imported intermediate inputs versus imported final consumption goods. I develop and estimate a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model with a two-tier import structure, endogenous wage bargaining, labor market frictions, and nominal rigidities. The framework separates a supply-side marginal-cost channel from a demand-side expenditure-basket channel. Estimation using U.S. macroeconomic and trade data shows that intermediate-input inflation shocks generate more persistent domestic inflation via production costs and wage–price feedback, while final-goods shocks primarily reweight the consumption basket with shorter-lived inflation effects. The results highlight why import composition matters for monetary policy design during supply-chain disruptions and trade-policy shifts.
